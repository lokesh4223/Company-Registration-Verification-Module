# Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Company Registration system, covering all testing types, tools, and methodologies to ensure high-quality, reliable software.

## Testing Philosophy
Our testing approach follows the Testing Pyramid model with a focus on:
- Automated unit tests forming the base
- Integration tests in the middle
- End-to-end tests at the top
- Manual exploratory testing for user experience validation

## Testing Types

### Unit Testing
**Purpose**: Validate individual components and functions in isolation

**Coverage Targets**:
- 90%+ code coverage for critical business logic
- 80%+ code coverage for supporting functionality
- 100% coverage for error handling paths

**Tools**:
- Backend: pytest, unittest
- Frontend: Jest, React Testing Library

**Examples**:
- Model validation logic
- Service layer functions
- Utility functions
- API serializer validation

### Integration Testing
**Purpose**: Validate interactions between integrated components

**Scope**:
- Database operations
- API endpoint responses
- External service integrations
- Authentication flows

**Tools**:
- Backend: Django Test Client, pytest
- Frontend: Jest with mocking, Cypress for API integration

**Examples**:
- Database read/write operations
- API request/response handling
- Third-party service mocking
- Middleware behavior

### End-to-End Testing
**Purpose**: Validate complete user workflows and system behavior

**Scope**:
- Critical user journeys
- Cross-component workflows
- Data persistence and retrieval
- Error scenarios

**Tools**:
- Cypress for web application testing
- Postman/Newman for API testing

**Examples**:
- Complete company registration flow
- User authentication and authorization
- Document upload and retrieval
- Report generation and export

### Performance Testing
**Purpose**: Ensure system meets performance requirements under expected load

**Metrics**:
- Response times under load
- Concurrent user capacity
- Database query performance
- Memory and CPU utilization

**Tools**:
- JMeter for load testing
- Locust for distributed load testing
- New Relic for monitoring

**Scenarios**:
- Peak registration period simulation
- Database stress testing
- API response time validation
- Concurrent user handling

### Security Testing
**Purpose**: Identify and remediate security vulnerabilities

**Areas**:
- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- Data encryption
- Network security

**Tools**:
- OWASP ZAP for automated scanning
- Burp Suite for manual testing
- Bandit for Python security scanning
- npm audit for frontend dependencies

**Examples**:
- SQL injection attempts
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) testing
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) validation
- Authentication bypass attempts

### Accessibility Testing
**Purpose**: Ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities

**Standards**:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Section 508 compliance

**Tools**:
- axe-core for automated testing
- Lighthouse for accessibility auditing
- Manual testing with screen readers

**Areas**:
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast ratios
- Alternative text for images

## Test Environment

### Development Environment
- Local development machines
- Unit and integration tests run on developer workstations
- Mocked external dependencies

### CI/CD Environment
- Automated testing on every code commit
- Parallel test execution for faster feedback
- Integration with version control system

### Staging Environment
- Production-like infrastructure
- Complete end-to-end testing
- Performance and security testing
- User acceptance testing

## Testing Tools and Frameworks

## Test Data Management

### Data Generation
- Synthetic test data generation
- Data anonymization from production
- Factory patterns for consistent test data

### Data Isolation
- Separate test databases
- Transaction rollback for test cleanup
- Database seeding for consistent starting state

### Data Privacy
- No real personal data in test environments
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Regular data cleanup procedures

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing Pipeline
1. Code commit triggers build
2. Static code analysis
3. Unit test execution
4. Integration test execution
5. Code coverage reporting
6. Security scanning
7. Deployment to test environment
