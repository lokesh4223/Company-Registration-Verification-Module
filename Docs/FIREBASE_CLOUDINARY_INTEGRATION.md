4. **User Controller Updates** (`backend/controllers/userController.js`):
   - Integrated Firebase user creation during registration
   - Maintained backward compatibility with local authentication

5. **Server Configuration** (`backend/server.js`):
   - Added authentication routes to the Express application

### Frontend Implementation

1. **Authentication Form** (`frontend/src/components/AuthForm.jsx`):
   - Integrated Firebase client SDK
   - Implemented Firebase authentication for login and registration
   - Added Firebase ID token handling
   - Connected to backend authentication endpoints

2. **API Service** (`frontend/src/services/api.js`):
   - Created dedicated authentication API service
   - Added Firebase authentication endpoints

3. **Environment Configuration** (`frontend/.env`):
   - Added Firebase configuration variables

## Cloudinary Image Storage Integration

### Backend Implementation

1. **Cloudinary Utility Module** (`backend/utils/cloudinary.js`):
   - Created Cloudinary SDK configuration
   - Implemented image upload functionality
   - Added image deletion capability
   - Added image details retrieval

2. **Company Controller Updates** (`backend/controllers/companyController.js`):
   - Integrated Cloudinary image upload during company creation
   - Added image update functionality during company updates
   - Implemented image deletion during company deletion
   - Added image transformation options (resizing, cropping)

### Frontend Implementation

1. **Company Form** (`frontend/src/components/CompanyForm.jsx`):
   - Added file input fields for logo and banner images
   - Implemented image upload handling
   - Connected to backend company endpoints

2. **API Service** (`frontend/src/services/api.js`):
   - Created dedicated company API service
   - Added company CRUD endpoints with image handling

## Key Features Implemented

### Firebase Authentication
- Email/password authentication
- SMS OTP verification
- Firebase ID token verification
- Integration with local JWT authentication
- User synchronization between Firebase and local database

### Cloudinary Image Storage
- Company logo upload and management
- Company banner upload and management
- Automatic image transformations (resizing, cropping)
- Secure image deletion
- Public URL generation for image display

## API Endpoints

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/firebase-login` - Firebase authentication
- `POST /api/auth/send-otp` - Send SMS OTP
- `POST /api/auth/verify-otp` - Verify SMS OTP

### Company Endpoints (with Image Support)
- `POST /api/companies` - Create company with image upload
- `PUT /api/companies/:id` - Update company with image management
- `DELETE /api/companies/:id` - Delete company with image cleanup

## Environment Variables

### Backend
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - Firebase project ID
- `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` - Firebase service account private key
- `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` - Firebase service account email
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` - Cloudinary cloud name
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` - Cloudinary API key
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` - Cloudinary API secret

### Frontend
- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` - Firebase API key
- `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` - Firebase auth domain
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - Firebase project ID
- `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` - Firebase storage bucket
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` - Firebase messaging sender ID
- `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID` - Firebase app ID
- `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` - Cloudinary cloud name
- `VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` - Cloudinary API key
- `VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` - Cloudinary API secret

## Testing Considerations

1. **Firebase Authentication Testing**:
   - Test email/password registration flow
   - Test email/password login flow
   - Test SMS OTP sending and verification
   - Test token verification and expiration

2. **Cloudinary Integration Testing**:
   - Test image upload functionality
   - Test image transformation options
   - Test image deletion and cleanup
   - Test error handling for upload failures

## Security Considerations

1. **Firebase Security**:
   - Secure storage of service account credentials
   - Token verification for all authenticated requests
   - Proper error handling to prevent information disclosure

2. **Cloudinary Security**:
   - Secure API key management
   - Validation of uploaded file types
   - Proper access control for uploaded images

## Future Enhancements

1. **Firebase Enhancements**:
   - Implement social login providers (Google, Facebook)
   - Add multi-factor authentication
   - Implement custom claims for role-based access control

2. **Cloudinary Enhancements**:
   - Add image optimization settings
   - Implement advanced transformation options
   - Add support for video uploads
