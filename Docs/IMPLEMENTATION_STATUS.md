## Key Files and Components

### Backend
- `server.js` - Main application entry point
- `routes/` - API route definitions
- `controllers/` - Business logic implementation
- `models/` - Database models and queries
- `middleware/` - Authentication and validation middleware
- `utils/` - Utility functions (Firebase, Cloudinary)
- `services/` - Service layer implementations

### Frontend
- `src/app.jsx` - Main application component
- `src/components/` - React components organized by feature
- `src/services/` - API service integration
- `src/store/` - Redux store configuration
- `src/theme.js` - Material-UI theme configuration
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions

## Integration Points

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers/logs in through frontend
2. Firebase handles authentication
3. Frontend sends Firebase token to backend
4. Backend verifies token and creates/returns JWT
5. Frontend uses JWT for subsequent API calls

### Company Registration Flow
1. User completes onboarding steps
2. Data validated on frontend and backend
3. Company profile created in database
4. Images uploaded to Cloudinary
5. Profile information synchronized

### Job Management Flow
1. Employer creates job posting
2. Job stored in database
3. Job listed in dashboard
4. Candidates can apply to jobs
5. Applications tracked and managed

## Performance Considerations

### Backend
- Database connection pooling
- Query optimization
- Input validation and sanitization
- Efficient API response formatting

### Frontend
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimized image handling
- Efficient state management
- Minimal re-renders

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Testing
- Unit tests for controllers and models
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Database migration testing
- Authentication flow testing

### Frontend Testing
- Component unit tests
- Integration tests for user flows
- Form validation testing
