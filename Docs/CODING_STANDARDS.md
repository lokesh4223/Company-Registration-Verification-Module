# Coding Standards

## Overview
This document defines the coding standards and best practices for the Company Registration system to ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality across all codebases.

For internship assignment coding requirements, please refer to the specific guidelines in [INTERNSHIP_ASSIGNMENT.md](INTERNSHIP_ASSIGNMENT.md).

## General Principles

### Readability
- Code should be self-documenting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prioritize clarity over cleverness
- Write code for the next developer who reads it

### Maintainability
- Keep functions and classes small and focused
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- Minimize coupling between components
- Maximize cohesion within modules

### Consistency
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Use uniform code formatting
- Apply consistent error handling

## Backend Coding Standards (Python/Django)

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length of 88 characters (Black formatter standard)
- Use meaningful variable names with underscores_for_separation

### Imports
- Group imports in the following order:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Related third-party imports
  3. Local application/library specific imports
- Use explicit imports rather than wildcards
- Place imports at the top of the file

### Naming Conventions
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., CompanyRegistrationService)
- Functions and variables: snake_case (e.g., validate_company_data)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS)
- Private members: prefixed with underscore (e.g., _internal_method)

### Documentation
- Use docstrings for all public modules, classes, and functions
- Follow Google Python Style Guide for docstrings
- Include type hints for function parameters and return values
- Comment complex logic that isn't self-explanatory

### Error Handling
- Use specific exception types rather than generic exceptions
- Log errors with appropriate context and severity levels
- Handle exceptions at the appropriate level
- Don't catch exceptions you can't handle meaningfully

### Django Specific Standards
- Use Django's ORM rather than raw SQL when possible
- Leverage Django's built-in validation
- Follow Django's app organization patterns
- Use Django's class-based views when appropriate
- Implement proper database migrations

### Model Design
- Use descriptive field names
- Add help_text and verbose_name for fields
- Implement __str__ methods for all models
- Use proper field types (e.g., EmailField for email addresses)
- Add indexes for frequently queried fields

### Views and APIs
- Keep views thin and delegate business logic to services
- Use serializers for data validation and transformation
- Implement proper pagination for list views
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Handle authentication and authorization consistently

## Frontend Coding Standards (JavaScript/React)

### Code Organization
- Organize files by feature rather than file type
- Use index.js files for clean imports
- Keep component files focused and small
- Separate presentational and container components

### Component Design
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop typing with PropTypes or TypeScript
- Destructure props for cleaner code
- Use default props for optional properties
- Implement memoization where appropriate

### State Management
- Keep state as local as possible
- Lift state up only when necessary for sharing
- Use Redux Toolkit for global state
- Prefer useState and useReducer for local state
- Use context sparingly and appropriately

### Styling
- Use CSS modules for component-scoped styles
- Follow BEM naming convention for class names
- Prefer utility classes over custom CSS when possible
- Implement responsive design principles
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography

### JavaScript/TypeScript Standards
- Use ES6+ features when available
- Prefer const over let, let over var
- Use arrow functions for anonymous functions
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use async/await instead of callbacks

### Testing
- Write tests for all new components and functions
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Mock external dependencies in tests
- Test user interactions and edge cases
- Maintain high test coverage for critical functionality

## Database Standards

### Schema Design
- Use descriptive table and column names
- Normalize data appropriately
- Add constraints for data integrity
- Index frequently queried columns
- Use appropriate data types

### Migrations
- Create migrations for all schema changes
- Write reversible migrations when possible
- Test migrations in staging environment
- Document breaking changes in migration files

### Queries
- Use ORM methods instead of raw SQL when possible
- Optimize queries with select_related and prefetch_related
- Avoid N+1 query problems
- Use database transactions for related operations

## Security Standards

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server
- Use allowlists rather than blocklists
- Sanitize user-generated content
- Implement proper file upload validation

### Authentication
- Use strong password hashing (bcrypt)
- Implement proper session management
- Use HTTPS for all authentication flows
- Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints

### Authorization
- Implement role-based access control
- Check permissions at both UI and API levels
- Use decorators or middleware for authorization checks
- Log unauthorized access attempts

## Version Control Standards

### Commit Messages
- Use conventional commit format
- Write clear, concise subject lines
- Provide detailed body descriptions for complex changes
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

### Branching Strategy
- Use feature branches for all new development
- Merge to main only through pull requests
- Delete branches after merging
- Use descriptive branch names

### Pull Requests
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Include comprehensive descriptions
- Request reviews from appropriate team members
- Address all feedback before merging

## Code Review Standards

### Review Process
- Review all code before merging
