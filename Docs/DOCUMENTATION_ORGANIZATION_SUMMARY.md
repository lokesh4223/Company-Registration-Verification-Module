# Documentation Organization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the documentation cleanup and organization process completed for the Company Registration system. The goal was to remove waste files and create the best documentation structure for the project.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Files Removed
The following redundant or outdated documentation files were removed:
- `DOCUMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Outdated index file referencing non-existent documents
- `FRONTEND_BACKEND_SUMMARY.md` - Inaccurate summary mentioning Python/Django instead of Node.js/Express
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Redundant with `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`

### 2. Files Organized
The remaining documentation was organized into a clean structure with a new README.md file providing an overview of all documentation.

### 3. Documentation Structure Created
A comprehensive README.md was created to guide users through the documentation with the following categories:
- Project Overview
- Setup and Configuration
- Technical Documentation
- Development Guidelines
- Testing
- Implementation Details
- Project Status
- Maintenance
