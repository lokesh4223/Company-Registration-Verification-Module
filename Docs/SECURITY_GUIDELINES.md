# Security Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the security policies, practices, and guidelines for the Company Registration system to ensure the protection of data and compliance with industry standards.

## Data Protection

### Data Classification
The system handles the following types of data:
- **Public Data**: General company information available in public records
- **Private Data**: Business contact information, employee details
- **Confidential Data**: Financial information, internal documents
- **Restricted Data**: Personal identification information, authentication credentials

### Data Encryption
- All data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.3
- Sensitive data at rest is encrypted using AES-256
- Database encryption for personally identifiable information (PII)
- Environment variables for storing secrets and API keys

### Data Retention
- Active company records: Retained indefinitely
- Inactive company records: Retained for 7 years
- Audit logs: Retained for 5 years
- Temporary files: Automatically deleted after 24 hours

## Authentication and Authorization

### User Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative users
- Password complexity requirements:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Password expiration every 90 days
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
User roles and permissions:
- **Public**: View public company information
- **User**: Register companies, view own registrations
- **Admin**: Manage all company records, user accounts
- **Auditor**: Read-only access to all data for compliance purposes

### Session Management
- Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Secure session tokens with HttpOnly and Secure flags
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- Automatic logout on browser close

## API Security

### Rate Limiting
- 1000 requests per hour per IP address
- 100 requests per minute per authenticated user
- Temporary IP blocking for abuse patterns

### Input Validation
- Server-side validation for all input data
- Sanitization of user-provided content
- Prevention of SQL injection through parameterized queries
- Protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

### CORS Policy
- Restricted to approved domains only
- No wildcard origins in production
- Credentials not allowed for cross-origin requests

## Network Security

### Firewall Configuration
- Restrict incoming connections to necessary ports only
- Whitelist known IP addresses for administrative access
- Regular firewall rule reviews and updates

### Secure Communication
- All external communication over HTTPS only
- Internal service communication encrypted where sensitive data is transmitted
- VPN required for remote administrative access

## Compliance

### Regulatory Compliance
- GDPR compliance for handling EU citizen data
- CCPA compliance for California resident data
- SOC 2 Type II compliance for security controls
- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing components

### Audit Requirements
- Comprehensive logging of all user activities
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Annual third-party security assessments
- Immediate incident response procedures

## Vulnerability Management

### Patch Management
- Monthly security updates for all system components
- Critical patches applied within 72 hours of release
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Code Security
- Static code analysis in development pipeline
- Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities
- Regular security training for development team
- Secure coding practices documentation

## Incident Response

### Reporting Security Issues
- Security vulnerabilities: security@company-registration-system.com
- Urgent issues: 24/7 incident response hotline
- Public disclosure: Coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy

### Response Procedures
1. Identification and classification of incident
2. Containment and evidence preservation
3. Eradication of threat and system restoration
4. Post-incident analysis and reporting
5. Implementation of preventive measures

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Monitoring
- Real-time monitoring of authentication attempts
- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- Automated alerts for security events
- Regular log analysis for potential threats

### Audit Logging
- All user actions logged with timestamps
- Administrative actions require additional approval
- Logs stored securely with restricted access
- Regular log review procedures

## Physical Security
- Data centers with 24/7 security personnel
- Biometric access controls for server rooms
- Video surveillance of critical infrastructure
- Environmental monitoring and backup systems

## Training and Awareness
- Annual security training for all employees
- Role-specific security training for technical staff
- Regular phishing simulation exercises
- Security awareness communications
